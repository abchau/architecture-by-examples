This repository demonstrates different architectures by implementing the same use case.

== Rationale

* majority of existing architecture examples are often
** too bulky
** too complicated
** impractical (narrow solution of solving specific problem in specific use case)
* a dead simple use case without any burden will help understand quicker and better

== What is in the scope of this project?

* demonstrate implementation of a simple subscription service
* demonstrate the original design created by the original author (Best effort to honor original intention but not guarantee. Comments are welcome.)

== What is not in the scope of this project?

* does not provide a sliver bullet recipe
* does not implement different variants of different architectures
* does not have a bug free and flawless design
* does not demonstrates how to use various approaches to tackle on same problem
* does not demonstrates how to use various design patterns

== Use case

The application has

* one external *endpoint*
* one *use case*
* one *aggregate*
** one *entity*
** two *value object*
* one database *table*

.A single subscription use case

.Database table
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscriptions (
	id BINARY(36) PRIMARY KEY,
	email VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL,
	status VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
	created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
	version BIGINT NOT NULL
);
----

== Usage

=== Requires

* Java 17

=== Build

* Import in your favourite IDE
* Start each project as a spring boot application individually or run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

=== Testing

* Go to http://localhost:8080/subscribe
+
image::demo1.png[] 
* *Four* conditions can be tested
** empty input
+
image::demo2.png[] 
** not empty but invalid email format
+
image::demo3.png[] 
** correct email format
+
image::demo4.png[] 
** correct email format but duplicate
+

* To verify DB records, go to:
