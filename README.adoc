This repository demonstrates different architectures by implementing a simple use case.

== Use case

The application has

* one external *endpoint*
* one *use case*
* one *aggregate*
** one *entity*
** two *value objects*
* one database *table*

.A single subscription use case

.Database table
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscriptions (
	id BINARY(36) PRIMARY KEY,
	email VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL,
	status VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
	created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
	version BIGINT NOT NULL
);
----

== Usage

=== Requires

* Java 21

=== Build

* Import in your favourite IDE
* Start each project as a spring boot application individually or run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

=== Testing

* Go to http://localhost:8080/create
+
image::demo1.png[] 
* *Four* conditions can be tested
** empty input
+
image::demo2.png[] 
** not empty but invalid email format
+
image::demo3.png[] 
** correct email format
+
image::demo4.png[] 
** correct email format but duplicate
+
image::demo5.png[] 

* To verify DB records, go to:
